====== camunda ======
Created Tuesday 24 November 2015

camunda rest uses [[ProcessEngineAuthenticationFilter]] to get and set current authenticated user for each request. No session bound authenticated user is used, REST style. Customized implementation of [[AuthenticationProvider]] can retrieve that user from session and use it instead.

to use separate database schemas, set databaseSchema='my_schema' and databaseTablePrefix='my_schema.'
because of bug: CAM-2097, also set databaseSchemaUpdate=none (which skips database checking completely)
