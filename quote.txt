Mark Twain
(95) A man is never more truthful than when he acknowledges himself a liar. 
(70) Principles have no real force except when one is well-fed. 
(58) If you tell the truth you don’t have to remember anything. 
(59) Education consists mainly in what we have unlearned. 
(52) You can’t depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus. 
(68) Whenever you find that you are on the side of the majority, it is time to reform. 
(81) God created war so that Americans would learn geography. 
(56) Give a man a reputation as an early riser and he can sleep ‘til noon. 
(69) Difference b/w the almost right word & the right word is really a large matter—’tis the difference b/w the lightning-bug & the lightning.

Oscar Wilde
Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much.
Anyone who lives within their means lacks imagination.
Biography lends to death a new terror.
If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they’ll kill you.
One should always play fairly when one has the winning cards.
Seriousness is the only refuge of the shallow.
The only thing to do with good advice is pass it on. It is never any use to oneself.
Whenever people agree with me I always feel I must be wrong.
Only the shallow know themselves.
